### Random Mouse Mover

This project is a simple Python script that uses the `pyautogui` library to randomly move the mouse cursor within a specified range on the screen. The script runs in an infinite loop until interrupted by the user (using `Ctrl + C`), making it useful for preventing the computer from going idle or for simulating user activity.

#### **Features**
- Randomly moves the mouse within a defined coordinate range.
- Runs indefinitely until stopped manually.
- Quick response to user interruption.

#### **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- `pyautogui` library
- `time` and `random` modules (standard with Python)

#### **Installation**
1. Install Python 3.x from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the `pyautogui` library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui
   ```

#### **Usage**
1. Run the script from your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python random_mouse_mover.py
   ```
2. To stop the script, press `Ctrl + C`.

#### **Disclaimer**
Use this script responsibly. Ensure it aligns with any applicable rules or policies, especially in a workplace or shared environment.
